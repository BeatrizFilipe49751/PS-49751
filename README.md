# Data Interface System for CIÃŠNCIAVITAE

This project aims to facilitate the management and interoperability of academic CVs, with a focus on integration with the [CIÃŠNCIAVITAE](https://cienciavitae.pt/) platform. It provides a modern web application composed of a Kotlin/Spring Boot backend and a React/TypeScript frontend, allowing users to import, edit, and export CV data in a structured and efficient way.

## Key Features

- Import academic CVs from external platforms such as Lattes (Brazil) via XML.
- Visualize structured CV data in an intuitive web interface.
- Export CVs to the CIÃŠNCIAVITAE platform using its official API.
- Store user data in a PostgreSQL relational database with structured entity mapping.
- Built with a modular and extensible architecture, enabling future integration with other platforms.

This system is designed to support researchers, academic institutions, and organizations in avoiding data duplication and ensuring high data quality.
